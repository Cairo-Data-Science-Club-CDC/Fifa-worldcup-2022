How to read this book?

-   This book was written with beginner R users in mind. Long wrangling pipes and ggplot constructions are avoided and instead broken into sequential, small, and intuitive steps. This doesn't mean that the analysis is limited to basic methods and simple workflow. Rather the goal is go a long distance to explain the relevant details in a clear and easy-to-follow.
